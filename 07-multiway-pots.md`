# Module 7: Multiway Pots

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand why **multiway pots** dramatically change GTO strategy compared to heads-up.
- Learn key adjustments: tighter ranges, lower frequencies, more nutted betting.
- Master **capping ranges**, reduced bluffing, and defending vs multiple opponents.
- Analyze common multiway spots (e.g., BB vs UTG + BTN).
- Avoid common leaks in multiway scenarios.

Multiway pots (3+ players) are tougher: lower equity realization, capped ranges, less fold equity. GTO shifts defensive.

## Why Multiway Changes Everything
- **Equity Distribution**: Your hand's equity drops (shared among players).
- **Range Capping**: Callers behind cap your range (fewer nuts).
- **Reduced Aggression**: Lower c-bet/barrel freqs (bluffs get called more).
- **Nut Advantage Critical**: Bet only strong/nuts; medium hands check/call.

## Key GTO Adjustments in Multiway
| Aspect                  | Heads-Up SRP/3-Bet                    | Multiway                              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **C-Bet Frequency**     | 60-90%                               | 30-60% (nutted only)                 |
| **Bluff:Value Ratio**   | 1:1 to 2:1                           | 1:2+ (fewer bluffs)                  |
| **Check-Raise Freq**    | 10-20%                               | 15-30% (traps with nuts)             |
| **Defending Freq**      | Wide (MDF high)                      | Tighter (cap range)                  |
| **Sizing**              | Small-medium                         | Larger (protect, but selective)      |

**Aggressor (IP/OOP)**: C-bet only nuts/draws with backup. Check medium strength.

**Defenders**: Check-raise more (nuts advantage OOP), overfold air.

## Common Multiway Spots
- **BB vs UTG + CO/BTN**: Defend tighter preflop (cap UTG). Postflop: Check most, CR strong.
- **Squeezes**: 3-bet less (multiway harder).
- **Flop Play**: Dry boards → bet top sets+; wet → check nuts to induce.

## Common Mistakes & Exploits
- Mistake: Over-bluffing multiway (called by multiple stations).
- Mistake: Over-calling with medium strength (dominated often).
- Exploit: Vs loose callers → value bet nuts only; vs passive → steal less.

**Tip**: Encourage multiway with speculative hands IP (suited connectors) for implied odds.

## Key Takeaways
- Multiway = play tighter, nutted, defensive.
- Reduce aggression: Bluff less, value thicker.
- Cap ranges mentally: "What nuts do I rep?"
- Solvers now handle 3-way (GTO Wizard 2025 updates) → study them.
- In live/low stakes: Multiway common → master patience.

## Quick Quiz

2. Best hands to bet multiway?  
   **Answer: Nuts + strong draws**
