# Module 11: Exploiting Deviations from GTO

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Quickly **identify population tendencies** and individual leaks at your stakes.
- **Adjust ranges and frequencies** against over-folding, over-calling, passive, or maniac opponents.
- Use **node locking** in solvers to model real opponents and find maximum-exploit strategies.
- Balance exploitation with protection (avoid becoming exploitable yourself).
- Build a simple, profitable adjustment system you can use at the table.

GTO is your unbreakable baseline. Exploitation is where you print money.

## Step 1: Identify Population Tendencies
Common leaks by stake (2025 data):

| Stake          | Overfold to…       | Overcall with…     | Other Common Leaks                  |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Micros**     | C-bets, 3-bets     | Weak pairs, gutshots | Rarely bluff-raise, auto-call flops |
| **Low Stakes** | Turn barrels, river overbets | Top pair          | Under-bluff rivers, passive turns   |
| **Mid Stakes** | River bets         | Middle pairs       | Over-defend BB, weak check-raises   |
| **High Stakes**| Small bets         | Thin value         | Very balanced—exploit subtly        |

*(Source: Upswing Poker – Key stats to track for exploits)*

**Key Stats to Track** (HUD/Tracker):
- Fold to Flop C-Bet (target >65% = bluff more)
- Fold to Turn C-Bet (>70%)
- WTSD (Went to Showdown >30% = call less rivers)
- Aggression Frequency by street

## Step 2: Make Adjustments
**Simple Adjustment Table** (use at table)

| Opponent Leak           | Your Adjustment                              | Example                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Overfolds c-bets**    | C-bet 90-100%, smaller size                  | BTN vs BB dry flop → 33% pot 95%     |
| **Overcalls flops**     | Value bet thinner, check medium strength     | Top pair good kicker = bet 75%       |
| **Never raises turns**  | Barrel turn 80%+ with air + value            | Missed draws become turn bluffs      |
| **Overfolds river**     | Bluff rivers huge (150%+ overbet)            | Missed flush draw → 150% pot bluff   |
| **Calls too much river**| Value bet TPTK+, fold marginal showdown    | Bet second pair for value            |

## Step 3: Node Locking in Solvers
**How to Do It** (PioSolver/GTO+):
1. Solve spot normally.
2. Go to opponent node (e.g., BB vs BTN c-bet).
3. Right-click → Node Lock → Set Fold = 80% (real opponent).
4. Re-solve → See your new c-bet % jump from 70% → 95%!
5. Save as “Exploit vs Overfolder”.

**GTO Wizard**: Use “Custom Solution” → adjust opponent frequencies → instant exploit strategy.

## Step 4: Balance Exploitation with Protection
- Don’t over-adjust vs observant regs (they’ll counter).
- Mix in some GTO frequency (e.g., bluff 80% instead of 100%).
- Change gears: Exploit one session, play GTO next.

**Rule**: Exploit recreational players hard. Play closer to GTO vs regulars.

## Weekly Study Routine
1. Review 50 hands from your database.
2. Tag 5 biggest leaks in opponents.
3. Node-lock 2 spots vs those leaks.
4. Add notes: “Villain X folds turn 75% → barrel 80%”.
5. Test in next session.

## Key Takeaways
- GTO keeps you safe; exploits win the most.
- Start with population tendencies → personalize with stats.
- Node locking = your secret weapon for max EV.
- Exploit recs hard, regs cautiously.
- Track results: You should see win-rate jump 2-5bb/100 when exploiting correctly.

## Quick Quiz
1. Opponent folds 75% to turn barrels. Your adjustment?  
   **Answer: Barrel turn 80%+ with air + value**

2. Best tool for real-opponent exploits?  
   **Answer: Node locking**

3. WTSD 35% means opponent…  
   **Answer: Overcalls → value bet thinner, bluff less**
