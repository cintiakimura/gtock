# Module 14: Mental Game & Study Routine

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Build an **effective study plan** tailored to GTO mastery (daily/weekly routines).
- Learn **hand review techniques** with GTO in mind (solver diffs, leaks).
- Master **tilt control** and mental resilience (bankroll management, routines).
- Balance **GTO study with exploitative play** for real results.
- Integrate everything into a sustainable long-term improvement system.

Your technical skills are solid now—mental game turns knowledge into wins.

## Building an Effective Study Plan
**SMART Goals**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.<grok-card data-id="33ff87" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
- Bad: "Study more."
- Good: "Drill 200 SRP IP spots in GTO Wizard Trainer this week (95% accuracy)."

**Weekly Routine** (10-20 hrs/week):

| Day       | Focus (2-4 hrs)                  | Tools                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Mon**   | Preflop drills + 1hr trainer    | GTO Wizard/Preflop+           <grok-card data-id="ef7360" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>|
| **Tue**   | Postflop spot (flop c-bet)      | Pio/GTO+ solve + review       |
| **Wed**   | Hand review (20 sessions)       | PokerTracker + solver diff    |
| **Thu**   | Trainer (turn/river) + exploits | Node-lock vs pop tendencies   |
| **Fri**   | Multiway/ICM spots              | Monker/GTO Wizard MTT         |
| **Sat**   | Play + live review              | Notes on HUD stats            |

**Daily Warmup (15-30 min)**: 50 trainer hands + breathing.

## Reviewing Hands with GTO
1. **Filter Database**: Big pots, mistakes (EV loss >5bb).
2. **Upload to Solver/GTO Wizard**: Diff your line vs GTO.
3. **Node Lock Opponents**: Model villain stats (e.g., overfold c-bet).
4. **Note Patterns**: "Overbluff rivers vs stations."
5. **Journal**: What? Why? Fix?

**Tools**: GTO Wizard Hand Analyzer (instant reports), PIO Replayer.

## Tilt Control & Mental Resilience
**Tilt Triggers**: Bad beats, downswings, ego (expecting wins).
**Bankroll Management**: 30-50 buy-ins cash, 100+ MTT → reduces stress.<grok-card data-id="87f418" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

**Techniques**:
- **Stop-Loss**: Quit after 2-3 buy-ins lost.
- **Breathing**: 4-7-8 (inhale 4s, hold 7s, exhale 8s).
- **Mental Hand History**: Log emotions + logic flaw.
- **A-Game Routine**: Sleep 8hrs, exercise, no play tired/hungry.

## Balancing GTO + Exploitative
- **80/20 Rule**: 80% GTO baseline, 20% exploits (vs fish).
- **Session Flow**: Warmup GTO trainer → Play exploits → Review GTO.
- **Track Winrate**: bb/100 or ROI – adjust if GTO pure loses to fish.

## Key Takeaways
- Study SMART: Drills > volume.
- Review weekly: Solver diffs = biggest gains.
- Mental > Technical: Bankroll/tile control = sustainability.
- Rest = Progress: Avoid burnout.
- You're ready for capstone!
